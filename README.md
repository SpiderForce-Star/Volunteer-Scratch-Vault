# Scratch Vault

Independent remaining-prize desk for scratch-off games.

**Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to any state lottery.**

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/SpiderForce-Star/Volunteer-Scratch-Vault)

**One-click live site:** [Import this repo on Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/import?s=https://github.com/SpiderForce-Star/Volunteer-Scratch-Vault)

That opens Vercel signed in with GitHub, creates the project, and gives you a `*.vercel.app` URL. The existing production URL (`https://volunteer-scratch-vault.vercel.app`) stays live; the Vercel project can be renamed later.

## What it does

Scratch Vault ranks $5, $10, $20, $25, $30, and $50 instant games from public remaining-prize counts:

- **Grand heat** — jackpots still in retail after known holdbacks (Tennessee’s Play It Again rule treats a posted “1 left” as no retail jackpot)
- **Medium heat** — mid-tier remaining prizes, so you skip games that look fine on top and are drained in the middle
- **Bust / avoid** — no effective retail top, or a collapsed mid-tier
- **Cash-out games** — Frenzy-style tickets whose “top prize” is a medium cash prize

Printed overall odds are not used to rank tickets. The desk does **not** improve the odds of any individual ticket and does **not** “beat the lottery.”

### Multi-state desks

Selector order: **TN KY SC OK MI AZ NC PA TX MO OH IL MA IA ID CT**.

| State | Desk | Holdback | Age |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tennessee (default) | Live overlay | Play It Again (subtract 1 top prize) | 18+ |
| Kentucky, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Missouri, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts, Iowa, Idaho, Connecticut | Compiled official remaining-prize tables | None | 18+ |
| Arizona | Compiled top prizes remaining (mids only when published) | None | 21+ |

State configs live in [`src/config/states.ts`](src/config/states.ts). Catalogs load through [`src/data/states/`](src/data/states/). Daily remaining-prize fetch: `GET /api/cron/daily-fetch` at `15 11 * * *` (06:15 CT).

## Data

Tennessee catalog: [`src/data/games.ts`](src/data/games.ts)  
State configs: [`src/config/states.ts`](src/config/states.ts)  
Heat / desk: [`src/lib/heat.ts`](src/lib/heat.ts), [`src/lib/heat.server.ts`](src/lib/heat.server.ts)

Tennessee source: [Tennessee Lottery scratch-offs](https://www.tnlottery.com/games/scratch-offs). Other desks use that state’s official remaining-prize page. Counts are compiled snapshots, not live store inventory. Iowa’s official table lists remaining prizes of $50 and greater.

Ticket faces are independent reconstructions for store identification. They are not official Lottery scans.

## Stripe

Checkout still uses the existing live Price IDs. Rename the products in the Stripe Dashboard to **Scratch Vault Full Access** (monthly and annual) so customer receipts and the hosted checkout page match the app. Webhook URL is unchanged: `https://volunteer-scratch-vault.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook`.

## Disclaimer

Informational only. Remaining counts change as tickets sell. This tool does not improve the odds of winning any prize. Play only if you are 18 or older. If gambling is a problem, call or text [1-800-GAMBLER](tel:18005224700).
